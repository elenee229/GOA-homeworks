#today we will talk about what's the difference between division,modulus and floor division

#first let's talk about division:division is a mathemathical operation,when we're dividing,we break down a larger number into smaller numbers,for example:

print(50/5)

#it gives us smaller number which is the correct answer,but what happens if we have this kind of situation and we need full number?:

print(50/6)

#we have a different kind of division which is called floor division,floor division is roundind the result to the nearest whole number,let's test it:

print(50//6)

#yeah it rounds the result,but what if we want to know what's remaining?to know that,we have third type of division which is called modulus,modulus shows us the remaining of the number that was divided.let's see:

print(50%6)

#we came to the conclusion,in python we have three types of division,one divides correctly,one rounds up the result and one shows us the remaining.

#thank you!
