<button>the main ones</button>

<h1>as we know,programing has many different ways and languages,today we'll tell u about 5 most common and aknowledget programing languages,before that i'll tell you who discovered programing and when</h1>

<button>discovery</button>

<h2>The first programming language was developed in 1883 when Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage worked together on the Analytical Engine, which was a primitive mechanical computer</h2>

<button>python</button>

<h3>Python was created by Guido van Rossum and was first released in 1991. It's a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. It’s widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more</h3>

<button>javaScript</button>

<h4>JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich and was first released in 1995. Originally developed for web browsers, it is a high-level, interpreted programming language. JavaScript is primarily used for client-side scripting to create dynamic and interactive web content. It supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles, and is now also used on the server side, thanks to environments like Node.js. It’s a core technology of the web, alongside HTML and CSS</h4>

<button>java</button>

<h5>Java was created by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems, with its first public release in 1995. It is an object-oriented programming language that emphasizes portability, security, and robustness. Java is designed to run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making it platform-independent. It’s widely used in enterprise applications, web development, mobile applications, and large-scale systems</h5>

<button>C</button>

<h6>C was developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. It was initially created to implement the Unix operating system. C is a general-purpose, high-level programming language known for its efficiency and control over system resources. It supports procedural programming and has influenced many other programming languages, including C++, C#, and Java. C is widely used for system programming, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications</h6>
