<!--attributes gives us more informations about tags,so far i only know 5 attributes so i'll talk about them:1.src 2.href
 3.alt 4.width 5.height.-->
 <h2>src</h2>
 <!--this attribute is used for image import,if we didn't had this attribute it'd hard to add image on our website.for example-->
<img src="heart.png">
<br></br>
<!--yeah this attribute is good but i think it is too big for the whole website,that's why we have this attributes:width and height.it lets us control size of the image.we also have aspect ratio.aspect ratio help us balance proportions between height and width.there is a mathematical formula for it:ratio=w/h-->
<img src="heart.png" width="100" height="100">

<!--href is used in a tag,we put the addres of the link that we want to go to inside.for an example-->
<a href="hi.html">hi</a>

<h4>alt</h4>
<!--alt attribute is used in img tag,if image doesn't load,it gives us alternative information about this image.for an example:-->
