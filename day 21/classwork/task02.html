<!--inline elements only take the space they need-->
<!--blockline elements take as much space as they can,for an example:-->
<html>
    <head><title></title></head>
    <body>
        <header>
            <h1 style="background-color: blueviolet;border-width: 3px ;border-style: dotted; border-color: blue;">hello world</h1><!--as we see <h1> element took as much space as it could,which means that this element is inline element-->
            <button style="background-color: chocolate;border-width: 3px;border-style: solid;border-color: darkblue; ">hello world</button>   <!--element button only took as much space as it needed,so it's blockline--> 
        </header>
    </body>
</html>
