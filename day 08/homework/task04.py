#what is difference between integer and float

# when we do mathematical operation in python,in this case division,we need to use (/) to divide numbers,but there is two kinds of divisions in python,one in dividing with float,and second one is dividing with integer,but what does that mean?in integer we only have whole numbers,we can't have numbers with demical points,so we use // to divide numbers,for an example

print(7//6) 

#it gives us 1,because answer can only be whole numbers,but with  float,you can divide numbers and get the answer with demical point,let's see

print(7/6)

#float = / , integer = //.this is the example of division,it works on every mathematical operation.
