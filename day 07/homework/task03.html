    <h1>Annexation of Tbilisi(1122) </h1>
  <i><p>The annexation of Tbilisi was one of the most important measures taken by the royal government of David the Builder to strengthen and centralize the feudal monarchy of Georgia.

    At the end of 1121, David laid siege to Tbilisi. The city tried to resist, but the Georgian military attacks were so strong that it made no sense to continue the battle. The siege also put the population in a difficult situation. The rulers of Tbilisi decided to negotiate with the king - they sent ambassadors to David and asked for a truce, but the king's decision was unshakable - Tbilisi had to submit to the central government, and therefore David refused to negotiate with the ambassadors. [ 1 ] In mid-February 1122, the Georgian army launched a decisive attack and took the city. David the Builder showed great severity towards the population - he killed many, put five hundred people on spiked saris and tortured them to death. [ 2 ] Within a few days, he established order in the city and stopped all violence. After the capture of Tbilisi, David moved the capital of Georgia from Kutaisi to here again.</p></i>
