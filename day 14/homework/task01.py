#control flow is an order,that computer executes as it's asked for.we have three types of control flow:sequential,iteration and selection.sequential is an execution,that should be done by order.for example we have three lines
print("hello world")
print(23)
print(44.5)
#this will be executed from the start(by order)
#iteration is an order which makes a loop untill it reaches the final number.like this:
numbers=(5,8,9,45)
for num in numbers:
    print(num)
#selection is an order which makes different options to choose one.
